Kyosuke Ishibashi is a master's cource student of Mechano-Informatics, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology in the University of Tokyo. His research interests include soft robotics, robot hand and manipulation. He is engaged in hydraulic soft hand for automating picking and setting tasks of flexible objects including foods. The focus of his research is to develop a robot hand that can provide sufficient force, speed, and stiffness to achieve the required functionality. 

東京大学大学院情報理工学系研究科知能機械情報学専攻修士2年の石橋亨祐です。ソフトロボットハンドやマニピュレーションの研究を行っています。人間の手のような器用さを持ち、機能に合わせて十分な力や速度、柔軟性を発揮できるロボットハンドを開発し、食品などの不定形柔軟物体のピッキング作業の自動化を目指しています。
